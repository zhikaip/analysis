# Analysis I, Appendix A.6: Some examples of proofs and quantifiers

Some examples of proofs and quantifiers in Lean

-/

/-- Proposition A.6.1 -/
example : ∀ ε > (0:ℝ), ∃ δ > 0, 2 * δ < ε := by
  intro ε hε
  use ε / 3
  constructor
  . positivity
  . linarith

example : ¬ ∃ δ > 0, ∀ ε > (0:ℝ), 2 * δ < ε := by

/-- Proposition A.6.2.  The proof below is somewhat non-idiomatic for Lean, but illustrates how to implement a "let ε be a quantity to be chosen later" type of proof. -/
example : ∃ ε > 0, ∀ x, 0 < x ∧ x < ε → sin x > x / 2 := by
  use ?eps  -- we will choose this later
  constructor
  swap -- defer the checking of positivity until later

    ext x
    apply HasDerivAt.deriv
